revelyusuf.net

This is my first Django Project.Here this is the home page of my own website that i have designed.I used Jinja templates of Python for this. What i have used::

Django:

Django is a free and open-source web framework, written in Python, which follows the model-view-template (MVT) architectural pattern.It is maintained by the Django Software Foundation (DSF), an independent organization established as a non-profit. Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. Django emphasizes reusability and "pluggability" of components, rapid development, and the principle of don't repeat yourself. Python is used throughout, even for settings files and data models. Django also provides an optional administrative create, read, update and delete interface that is generated dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models.

Some well-known sites that use Django include the Public Broadcasting Service,Pinterest,Instagram,Mozilla, The Washington Times, Disqus,Bitbucket, and Nextdoor

JINJA:

Jinja2 is one of the most used template engines for Python. It is inspired by Django's templating system but extends it with an expressive language that gives template authors a more powerful set of tools. On top of that it adds sandboxed execution and optional automatic escaping for applications where security is important.

It is internally based on Unicode and runs on a wide range of Python versions from 2.4 to current versions including Python 3.

Who uses it?

Mozilla, SourceForge, Instagram, NPR etc

HTML5:

HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and current version of the HTML standard. HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves and rationalizes the markup available for documents, and introduces markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications. For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a candidate for cross-platform mobile applications, because it includes features designed with low-powered devices in mind.

CSS3:

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language.[1] Although most often used to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.
